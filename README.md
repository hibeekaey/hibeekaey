### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have almost a decade of Software Engineering experience and work with React, Vue, Go, Node, Typescript, Python, and Flutter, as well as Postgres and MongoDB databases. I carry out unit and end-to-end testing with Mocha and Jest. Likewise, I've put up infrastructure on GCP and AWS utilizing Kubernetes, Docker Containers, and Lambdas to execute highly scalable API microservices deployed using a CI/CD pipeline. Furthermore, I've worked with Fintech companies in Nigeria, the United States, and Brazil.
