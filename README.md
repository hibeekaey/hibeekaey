### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a seasoned software engineer with a proven track record of building reliable applications using a blend of frontend (React, Vue, TypeScript), backend (Go, Node, Python), databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB), and cloud technologies (Kubernetes, Docker, Lambdas, GCP, AWS).  My commitment to thorough testing (Mocha, Jest) and CI/CD practices ensures the delivery of high-quality code.  Furthermore, my experience in the Fintech sector (Nigeria, US, Brazil) provides me with valuable insights into the unique security and compliance challenges of the financial industry.
