### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have over 6 years of Software Engineering experience and work with React, Vue, Node, Typescript, Python, and Flutter, as well as Postgres and Mongo databases. I carry out unit and end-to-end testing with Mocha and Jest. Likewise, I've put up infrastructure on GCP and AWS utilizing Kubernetes, Docker Containers, and Lambdas to execute highly scalable API microservices deployed using a CI/CD pipeline. Furthermore, I've worked with Fintech companies in Nigeria, the United States, and Brazil.
