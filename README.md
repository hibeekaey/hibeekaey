### Hi there 👋

---

I'm **Ibukun Dairo**, a seasoned **Platform Engineer and DevOps Leader** with 10+ years of experience building **cloud-native infrastructure**, developer tooling, and resilient applications across **Fintech**, **Streaming**, and **SaaS** ecosystems in **Nigeria, the US, and Brazil**.

---

I specialize in:  
- ✨ **Platform Engineering & Developer Experience**  
- ⚡️ **Infrastructure as Code** (Terraform, Helm, ArgoCD)  
- ✅ **CI/CD & GitOps** (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI)  
- ⚖️ **Observability** (OpenTelemetry, Datadog, Prometheus)  
- 🚀 **Cloud & Containers** (Kubernetes, AWS, GCP, Docker)  
- ⚙️ **Languages & Stacks**: Go, Python, TypeScript, Node.js, React  

---

My leadership work at **Paramount (PlutoTV)**, **Traive Finance**, and **Cuesoft** has driven:  
- ↓ 35% reduction in P1 incidents via full-stack observability  
- ↑ 40% faster recovery time (MTTR) through SLO-based alerting  
- ↑ 50% CI/CD adoption with reusable pipelines and deployment tooling  
- ↓ 90% infra downtime reduction from scaling DevOps maturity  

---

I'm passionate about **mentoring engineers**, building **reliable platforms**, and promoting **open-source contributions** to improve software delivery across teams and orgs.
